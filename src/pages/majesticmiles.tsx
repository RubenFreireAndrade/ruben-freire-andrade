              I designed and deployed a website for Majestic Miles, a chauffeur
              service startup, using React and Tailwind CSS to create a sleek,
              responsive user interface. The site is hosted on Cloudflare,
              leveraging serverless Workers to streamline API functionalities,
              ensuring fast and efficient handling of customer bookings and
              inquiries. Here is the result:{" "}

              The PlaceKit Autocomplete API allows users to quickly input their

              The custom booking form was designed with key fields tailored to a
              chauffeur service, including date, time, and optional flight
              number entry. This ensures all critical details are captured,
              streamlining the booking process for both customers and the
              business.

              For seamless communication, the site leverages SendGrid for email
              routing, ensuring timely and reliable email notifications. All
              server-side logic, including job management, is efficiently
              handled using Cloudflareâ€™s serverless Workers, enabling fast,
              scalable request handling.
